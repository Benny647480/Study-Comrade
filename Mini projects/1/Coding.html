            Coding is the process of giving instructions to a computer to perform specific tasks. 
            Whether you want to build a website, create an app, or automate tasks, learning to code is an essential skill in today’s digital world.

        <h3>1. Understand What Coding Is</h3>
            <p>Coding is like writing a recipe, but instead of telling a person how to make a cake, you’re telling a computer how to solve a problem.</p>
        
        <h3>2. Pick a Beginner-Friendly Language</h3>
            <p>Start with HTML & CSS if you want to build websites, or Python if you want to focus on automation and data analysis.</p>
        
        <h3>3. Set Up Your Coding Environment</h3>
            <p>Install a code editor like VS Code and learn to run your code in the browser or terminal.</p>
        
        <h3>4. Learn by Building</h3> 
        <p>Create small projects like a personal website, a calculator, or a to-do list app.</p>
        
        <h3>5. Practice Daily</h3>
        <p>Dedicate at least 30 minutes every day to coding. The more you code, the better you get.</p>
        
        <h3>6. Share Your Work</h3>
        <p>Post your projects on GitHub, get feedback, and keep improving your skills.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Remember, you don’t have to know everything before you start. Coding is learned by doing, breaking, and fixing things.</p>
